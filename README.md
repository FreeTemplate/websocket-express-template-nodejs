# websocket-express-template-nodejs

This project provides a template for setting up a Node.js application with Express and WebSockets. It's designed to give developers a quick start when building real-time web applications.

## Features

- **Express Setup**: Pre-configured Express server with routes, making it easier to set up APIs or serve web pages.
- **WebSocket Integration**: Built-in WebSocket server setup that integrates seamlessly with the Express server.
- **Event Management**: Structured event handling mechanism using shared event handlers.
- **Example Routes**: Sample API routes (`/api/post` and `/api/get`) are provided to demonstrate request handling.
- **Modular Structure**: Organized folder and file structure, promoting best practices and easier scalability.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**: Clone the repository and run `npm install` to install all the required dependencies.
2. **Starting the Server**: Use the command `npm start` to launch the application.
3. **Connect via WebSocket**: The WebSocket server listens on the same port as the Express server. Connect using any WebSocket client to start real-time communication.

## How to Add New Events
